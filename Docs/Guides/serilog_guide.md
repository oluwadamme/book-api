# Structured Logging with Serilog: A Beginner's Guide

Right now, if you use the default `ILogger` built into .NET to track an error, it often looks something like this:
```csharp
_logger.LogError($"Failed to send email to {user.Email} at {DateTime.UtcNow}");
```

If your application prints this to the terminal, it generates a plain text string:
`[Error] Failed to send email to alice@example.com at 10:42 PM`

### The Problem with Plain Text
Imagine running a massive production API for 6 months. You now have **3 million lines of plain text in a log file**.
Suddenly, you notice Alice isn't receiving emails. You have to open the massive 5-gigabyte text file, hit `Ctrl+F`, and try to type `"Failed to send email to alice@example.com"` and furiously click "Next" hoping you find the exact error. 
It is a nightmare to debug.

## 1. Enter Structured Logging

**Structured Logging** fixes this by abandoning plain text entirely. Instead, every single log message is stored as a highly-queryable **JSON Object**.

Using a structured logger, your log actually looks like this behind the scenes:
```json
{
  "Timestamp": "2026-04-10T10:42:00Z",
  "Level": "Error",
  "MessageTemplate": "Failed to send email to {UserEmail}",
  "Properties": {
    "UserEmail": "alice@example.com",
    "Environment": "Production"
  }
}
```

Because it's JSON, you can throw these logs into a database or a log viewer and run magical queries like:
* *"Show me all `Error` logs where `UserEmail == 'alice@example.com'` in the last 24 hours."*
* *"Graph the number of `Warning` logs per minute."*

## 2. What is Serilog?

**Serilog** is the undisputed king of structured logging in .NET.

It works perfectly with the standard `ILogger<T>` interfaces you are already using in `AuthService.cs`, but it completely hijacks what happens when you call `_logger.LogError()`.

### Sinks (Where the logs go)
Serilog uses the concept of **Sinks**. A Sink is a destination for your logs. 
You can easily configure Serilog to send logs to multiple Sinks simultaneously:
1. **Console Sink:** Prints pretty, colorful text to your terminal while developing.
2. **File Sink:** Saves the raw JSON to a `.txt` file on your server.
3. **Seq / Datadog / Application Insights Sinks:** Automatically streams your JSON logs to a beautiful external website with massive dashboards and search bars.

## 3. How to Implement it conceptually

### Step 1: Install NuGet Packages
You would install the core library and any Sinks you want:
```bash
dotnet add package Serilog.AspNetCore
dotnet add package Serilog.Sinks.Console
dotnet add package Serilog.Sinks.File
```

### Step 2: Hijack `Program.cs`
You tell ASP.NET Core to abandon its default logger and use Serilog instead. You do this at the *very* top of the file before `WebApplication` is even built:

```csharp
using Serilog;

// 1. Configure Serilog before anything else starts
Log.Logger = new LoggerConfiguration()
    .WriteTo.Console()
    .WriteTo.File("logs/api-logs.json") // The File Sink!
    .CreateLogger();

try 
{
    var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

    // 2. Tell the builder to use Serilog
    builder.Host.UseSerilog();

    // ... exactly the rest of your Program.cs ...
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    Log.Fatal(ex, "The application failed to start correctly");
}
finally
{
    Log.CloseAndFlush();
}
```

### Step 3: Write Queryable Logs
You don't need to change `AuthService.cs` injections. You just change *how* you write the string!

**DO NOT use string interpolation (`$`) anymore!** 
If using `$`, it flattens the string into plain text. You must use Serilog's bracket syntax `{Property}` so it knows how to build the JSON.

```csharp
// BAD (Flattens to plain text):
_logger.LogError($"Failed to login user {request.Email}");

// GOOD (Creates a queryable JSON property called 'Email'):
_logger.LogError("Failed to login user {Email}", request.Email);
```

By switching to Serilog, you'll never again have to blindly `Ctrl+F` through millions of lines of terminal output to find out why a user hit a `500 Server Error`!
